Tips for submitting an issue for slick:

1. Do not use issues for support questions. For those, first study the documentation and if they do not contain an answer, use one of the community forums.

2. If you have a feature request, note that slick is a community project. As such, you need to get somebody to implement your idea and make a pull request.

3. If you have a bug repot, use the following template:

- Give a short, clear description in the issue title.
- Describe steps on how to reproduce the bug. Include a bare-bones test case (as small as possible) that demonstrates the bug.
- Describe what you expected to see and why.
- Describe what you saw. Include a cleaned-up version of any error messages or exception stack trace. If including an exception, make sure to include also the root cause (search for "Caused by:" in the stack trace).
- Describe your set-up (database used, configuration, etc)

As with feature requests, note that slick is a community project and the best way to get bugs fixed is to submit a pull request for fixing it, along with a test case that demonstrates the bug existed prior to the PR and does not after the PR.
